## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Desktop Capture API** - Prompts user to select screen/window/tab
2. **MediaRecorder API** - Records the selected media stream
3. **Web Audio API** - Merges microphone audio with screen capture
4. **Auto-Minimize** - Window minimizes before recording starts
5. **Smart Stop** - Detects window focus and stops recording instantly
6. **Direct Download** - Creates blob URL and triggers download

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension won't load
- Ensure all files are in the extension folder
- Check for errors in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try reloading the extension

### Recording fails to start
- Make sure you click **Share** (not Cancel)
- Allow microphone access when prompted
- Check browser console for errors

### No audio in recording
- Microphone permission was denied
- Recording continues as video-only
- Re-allow microphone in Chrome settings

### Video won't play
- Try VLC media player for better codec support
- Ensure recording was at least 2-3 seconds long
- Check if file size is greater than 0 bytes

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Auto-Minimize
The recorder window automatically minimizes 800ms after you click REC. This ensures:
- Window is completely hidden before recording starts
- Clean recordings without the recorder UI visible
- Smooth user experience

### Smart Stop
When you click the recorder window in your taskbar:
- Recording stops **immediately** on window focus
- Stops **before** the window paints on screen
- Ensures the recorder never appears in your video

### MP4 Support
The extension prioritizes MP4 (H.264) encoding:
- Better compatibility with video players
- Smaller file sizes
- Automatic fallback to WebM if MP4 unavailable
